Description
If there is a predefined word, the game isn't replayable. You already know the word, so thereâ€™s no longer any challenge. At this stage, let's make the game more challenging by choosing a word from a special list with a variety of options. This way, our game will have more replay value.

Objectives
Create the following list of words: 'python', 'java', 'kotlin', 'javascript'.
Program the game to choose a word from the list at random. You can enter more words, but let's stick to these four for now.
Examples
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the output.

Example 1. The computer randomly chose python from the list.

H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > python
You survived!
Example 2. The computer randomly chose something other than python from the list.

H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > python
You lost!
Example 3. The computer randomly chose something other than kotlin from the list.

H A N G M A N
Guess the word: > kotlin
You lost!
